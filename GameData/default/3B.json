{"text":"You steady your heart, pick yourself off the ground and dust yourself off. You know you can run a tavern greater than this guy’s ever seen and the longer you think about it the more it sounds like a good idea. Clearly you realize that you can’t stay within this town and with that being said you walk jauntily down a path into the great unknown. … … … Years have passed and as you reminisce about the distant past you can’t help but smile at your previous decisions. After all they led you here to the megalopolis called Crab City and here in the city of dreams have you made a killing by forming a monopoly on the juice industry. By choking out competitors and rising prices from your very own Tavern called The Malus Juicer. Life is good and with a fresh glass of Apple juice in hand you peacefully drift off to sleep.
