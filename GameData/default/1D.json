{"text":"You steal your determination and spirit through the flames knowing that if you can make it to the dam you can save the apples. You run breathing in smoke and dodging fire for what feels like hours but eventually you make it.You start ripping away at the foundations of the dam all the while the precious apple orchard burns behind you. At first there's only a trickle of water but slowly that grows bigger and bigger until in turn into a raging wave heading for the orchard. Swept up with the water you can only desperately swim as the water and flames collide resulting in a massive cloud of steam. You are knocked into a tree and black out.… ……When you next awake you are surrounded by your boss and the villagers who could see the huge steam cloud all the way from the village. “[Character Name] why did you knock down the village's only dam?” Boss Man accuses you. But when you explain why the surrounding villagers break out into cheers “Hurray for [Character Name] for without them the apple orchard would’ve burned down!” They lift you up and carry you to the village, chanting your name the entire way. You reenter the village as a hero.Congratulations You Have Found The Hero Ending[New Game]","skillmod":{"skill":"none","value":"0"},"exit":[{"trigger":"[New Game]","check":{"skill":"none","value":"0"},"out":"start","fail":""},{"trigger":"","check":{"skill":"none","value":"0"},"out":"","fail":""}]}
