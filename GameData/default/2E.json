As you get closer and closer to the orchard you see flames. You see flames rising into the sky and with horror you realize that the orchard is on fire! You panic and look around to see what you can do to help. Past the flaming orchard you see the village wooden dam, but looks far too dangerous to cross. Might as well just turn around and tell the boss the bad news.","skillmod":{"skill":"none","value":"0"},"exit":[{"trigger":"run to the wooden dam","check":{"skill":"none","value":"0"},"out":"1D","fail":""},{"trigger":"break the news to boss","check":{"skill":"none","value":"0"},"out":"2D","fail":""}]}
